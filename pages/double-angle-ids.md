# Trigonometric Double Angle Identities

The Double angle formulas are

- $\sin(2a) = 2sin(a)cos(a)$
- $\cos(2a) = \cos^2(a)-\sin^2(a) = 1 - 2\sin^2(a) = 2\cos^2(a) - 1$
- $\tan(2a) = \frac{2\tan(a)}{1 - \tan^2(a)}$

These formulas can be found directly from the trignonometric sum of angles formulas (see [[sum-angle-identities]]).

The additional identites for cosine are a result of applying the pythagorean identies. (see [[pythagorean-trig-ids]])

# Conjugate Radical Roots Theorem

If the coefficients of a polynomial are rational, then the conjugate of a radical root of the polynomial is also a root of the polynomial.

That is, if the polynomial has a root of the form $s+t\sqrt{u}$, where $\sqrt{u}$ is irrational, then $s-t\sqrt{u}$ is also a root.

# Conic Sections

Conic sections (or conics) are graphs in the plane resulting from the intersection of the plane with the surfaces of cones.

A more general definition is that a conic section is made up of all the points that satisfy

$$ Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0 .$$

Common conic sections are [[parabolas]], [[ellipses]], and [[hyperbolas]].
